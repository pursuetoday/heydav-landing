If the task of concentrating is a challenging one, rest assured, you aren't the only one.</i><p><p>Research shows that the average human being has an attention span of 8 seconds. This means that the same person who could binge-watch a whole Netflix series a decade ago can barely hold their attention for a YouTube Short today.</p><p>In a world of the easily distracted, companies must carefully navigate their email marketing campaigns. Since there are so many businesses competing for the customer's attention, a successful email marketing campaign proves itself worth the click.</p><h2>The impact of a short attention span on your email marketing strategy</h2><p>Safe to say, your target messages should pack a punch. But that's not enough. Successful marketing efforts achieve beyond initial recipient attraction and keep them interested till the very end.</p><p>When the email campaign is effective, readers won't just skim through the text. They will read the message body in detail all the way to the CTA.</p><h3>Create a catchy subject line</h3><p>Subject lines are like the first hello. If they're great, people won't forget them.</p><p>To create a compelling email subject line, make sure you do this instead:</p><h4>1. Keep it short</h4><p>Most email service providers cut off subject lines beyond 50 characters on mobile devices. Considering that most people use their smartphones to check emails, you should aim for full subject line visibility.</p><p>Aim to convey your point in 50 characters or less to make the most of your recipient's screen.</p><h4>2. Personalize with recipient name</h4><p>Most of us don't expect to see our name pop up in the Inbox without clicking on an email. Going against the grain by adding the recipient's name adds that shock factor that leads to an open.</p><p>Not to mention, personalized subject lines strengthen brand-to-subscriber relationships.</p><h4>3. Be mysterious</h4><p>Evoke a sense of curiosity with mysterious subject lines that hint at something special while keeping the mystery alive.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>Shortening attention spans is a growing pain among professional marketers. Be it a welcome email or seasonal marketing email, companies MUST adjust their strategy to satisfy the new order.</p>"
